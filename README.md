# ScalaCompilerPluginLab
This repo will create nothing, just some log for my scala plugin testing

# Log
- We can now print the members of a defined member (commit:1bde1df047d66140bbc243a77c63825244acec41)
- We can now print the tree in the compiled file now.Just don't know how to call methods from Global.Tree, looks like it provides some reflact feature, but I don't know how to call it.
